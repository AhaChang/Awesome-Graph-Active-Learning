# Graph Active Learning: A Survey

A comprehensive collection of Graph Active Learning (GAL) papers.


## üí° What is GAL?
> Graph Active Learning applies active learning to graph-structured data, strategically selecting valuable graph entities (nodes, edges, or subgraphs) for annotation to maximize GNN performance under limited labeling budgets.

![GAL Illustration](GAL_Workflow.png)


## üè∑Ô∏è Taxonomy
We categorize GAL methods along three orthogonal dimensions that capture the fundamental design choices in graph active learning: how entities are queried (AL mode), the quality of obtained labels (annotation type), and the criteria for entity selection (query strategy).

![Taxonomy](GAL_taxonomy.png)

### Active Learning Mode
- **Sequential**: Query one entity per iteration
- **Batch**: Query multiple entities per iteration  
- **One-step**: Query all entities in a single iteration

### Annotation Type  
- **Accurate**: Perfect oracle labels
- **Inaccurate**: Noisy oracle labels

### Query Strategy  
- **Uncertainty (U)**: Select entities where model is least confident
- **Diversity (D)**: Select entities distinct from labeled ones
- **Representative (R)**: Select prototypical entities covering distributions
- **Performance (P)**: Select entities with greatest model impact

<!-- > *In the table: ‚úì = uses strategy, ‚úó = doesn't use* -->

### Strategy Combination
- **Single**: Use one strategy only
- **Pipeline**: Apply strategies sequentially
- **Hyper-parameter**: Combine using fixed/adaptive weights
- **Optimization**: Learn optimal combination via RL/bandits
- **Hybrid**: Complex multi-stage combinations
